Initally, I created a basic index.html file and tested it by putting some text and images in.
Next, I created a header and navbar and format for my website with the idea of putting some images and a descreption section in.
Third, I realised that the descriptions looked really boring, so I put a video and link to a website instead.
For the next few classes, I tried to create rotating images to the sides of each section and tried to color the background. Alli helped me with roating the images, but I never figured out why the background color wouldn't change.
Sorry if any of that is spelled wrong, spellcheck isn't in here.
